# 👋 Hi there, I'm Francesco 
  
### 🦸‍♂️ About me

I hate to describe myself with a generic title - it may sound clichè, but I am a curious mind and a passionate learner.

I fell in love with mathematics in my early years, I can remember counting and adding numbers at 4 or 5: mathematics and logic reasoning have been a big part of my life ever since.

After pursuing a M.Sc. in pure mathematics, I decided to move into industry to solve real-world problems through mathematical models and machine learning.

### 💼 Where I Currently Work

I am a data scientist at [Edison](https://www.edison.it/en), one of the leading Italian electric utility company. 

###  💻 Side Project

When I have some spare time on weekends I maintain few projects:
- [Tabular Data Annotator](https://ts-annotator.herokuapp.com/) webapp to label tabular data. 
- [ATP Stats](https://atp-stats.herokuapp.com/) website for ATP tennis statistics and analytics.

Both projects are developed using python [dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) framework.

### 📚 Currently Learning More About

* __Bayesian Statistics__ from the [Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd Edition](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) book. While doing so, I am trying to complete some of the exercises using python [here](https://github.com/FBruzzesi/bda3-exercises)

* __Game Theory__ a subject that was on my _TODO_ list forever, I finally found some time to follow [Ben Polak course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM3rTU927io&list=PL6EF60E1027E1A10B&index=1&ab_channel=YaleCourses) from Yale University, available for free on Youtube.
