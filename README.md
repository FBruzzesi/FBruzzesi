# 👋 Hi there, I'm Francesco 
  
## 🦸‍♂️ About me

I am a data scientist with 4+ years of experience, a mathematician by training, and a passionate learner. 

I have in depth experience working on tabular data, time series, bayesian statistic and mathematical optimization.

## 💼 Employer

- Currently, I am a data scientist at [HelloFresh](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hellofresh/)🍋 in Berlin office.
- Previously I worked a senior data scientist at [Edison](https://www.edison.it/en)⚡ one of the leading Italian electric utility company. Here I was involved maily on mid and down stream projects on tabular data, time series, anomaly detection, and optimization.

##  💻 Side Project

When I have some spare time on weekends I maintain few projects:
- *Open Source*
  - [Timebasedcv](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/timebasedcv/): a python library that provides a cross validation strategy based on actual datetime values instead of indexes, of course compatible with scikit-learn cross validation API.
  - [Compclasses](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/compclasses/): a python utility library to simplify *composition* (over inheritance).
  - [Deczoo](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/deczoo/): a *zoo for python decorators*, a collection of decorators used on a daily basis.
- *Webapps* (Still open source):
  - [ATP Stats](https://github.com/FBruzzesi/atp_stats_webapp) is a webapp providing tennis analytics and insights in a more colorful and intuitive manner with respect to the official ATP Tour.
  - [Tabular Data Annotator](https://github.com/FBruzzesi/ts-annotator) a webapp to bulk label tabular data from a csv.

The latter two projects are developed using python [dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) framework and ~deployed on [heroku](https://heroku.com/)~ I need to migrate them to another hosting platform.
