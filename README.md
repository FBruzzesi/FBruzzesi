# 👋 Hi there, I'm Francesco 
  
### 🦸‍♂️ About me

I am a data scientist with 3+ years of experience, a mathematician by training, and a passionate learner. 

I'm especially interested in bringing value to a team or product, which, in my experience, often has translated to prefer simple, scalable and understandable solutions as opposed to overcomplex models when not necessary.

### 💼 Where I Currently Work

I am a senior data scientist at [Edison](https://www.edison.it/en), one of the leading Italian electric utility company. Here I mainly work on mid and down stream projects on tabular data, time series, anomaly detection, and optimization.

###  💻 Side Project

When I have some spare time on weekends I maintain few projects:
- [Deczoo](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/deczoo/) is a *zoo for python decorators*; I developed and currently maintain the library.
- [Tabular Data Annotator](https://ts-annotator.herokuapp.com/) webapp to bulk label tabular data from a csv. 
- [ATP Stats](https://atp-stats.herokuapp.com/) is a webapp providing tennis analytics and insights in a more colorful and intuitive manner with respect to the official ATP Tour.

The latter two projects are developed using python [dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) framework and deployed on [heroku](https://heroku.com/).

### 📚 Currently Learning More About

* __Bayesian Statistics__ from the [Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd Edition](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) book. While doing so, I am trying to complete some of the exercises using python [here](https://github.com/FBruzzesi/bda3-exercises)

* __Game Theory__ a subject that was on my _TODO_ list forever, I finally found some time to follow [Ben Polak course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM3rTU927io&list=PL6EF60E1027E1A10B&index=1&ab_channel=YaleCourses) from Yale University, available for free on Youtube.
