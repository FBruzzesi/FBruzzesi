# üëã Hi there, I'm Francesco
  
## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About me

I am a data scientist with 6+ years of experience, a mathematician by training, a passionate learner and an open source enthusiast.

I have in depth experience working on tabular data, time series, Bayesian statistic and mathematical optimization. I tend to prefer simple, scalable and understandable solutions as opposed to over-complex models when not necessary to bring value.

## üíº Employer

- Currently, I am a data scientist at [HelloFresh](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hellofresh/)üçã in Berlin office.
- Previously I worked a senior data scientist at [Edison](https://www.edison.it/en)‚ö° one of the leading Italian electric utility company. Here I was involved maily on mid and down stream projects on tabular data, time series, anomaly detection, and optimization.

## üíª OSS and side projects

When I have some spare time on weekends I maintain few projects:

- [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals): an extremely lightweight compatibility layer between Polars, pandas, Modin, cuDF, pyarrow (and more!). I am a core maintainer since Apr. 2024 (27M+ downloads a month).
- [scikit-lego](https://github.com/koaning/scikit-lego): since Sept. 2023 I am a maintainer of the project. The goal of the package is to allow to joyfully build new building blocks that are scikit-learn compatible (30k+ downloads a month).
- [iso-week-date](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/iso-week-date/) is a toolkit to work with strings representing [ISO Week date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) in two formats: week **YYYY-WNN** and week date **YYYY-WNN-D** (50k+ downloads a month).
- [Timebasedcv](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/timebasedcv/): a python library that provides a cross validation strategies based on _actual datetime_ values instead of indexes, of course compatible with scikit-learn cross validation API.
- [Compclasses](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/compclasses/): a python utility library to simplify *composition* (over inheritance).
- [Deczoo](https://fbruzzesi.github.io/deczoo/): a *zoo for python decorators*, a collection of decorators used on a daily basis.

- [ATP Stats](https://github.com/FBruzzesi/atp_stats_webapp) is a webapp providing tennis analytics and insights in a more colorful and intuitive manner with respect to the official ATP Tour.
