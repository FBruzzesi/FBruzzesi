# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Francesco 
  
### About me :person_red_hair:
I hate to describe myself with a generic title - it may sound clichÃ¨, but I am a curious mind and a passionate learner.
I fell in love with mathematics in my early years, I can remember counting and adding numbers at 4 or 5: mathematics and logic reasoning have been a big part of my life ever since.
After pursuing a M.Sc. in pure mathematics, I decided not to pursue a PhD, hence I moved into industry to solve real-world problems through mathematical models and machine learning.

### ðŸ’¼ Where I Currently Work:

I am a data scientist at [Edison](https://www.edison.it/en), one of the leading Italian electric utility company.

### ðŸ“š Currently Learning More About:

* __Bayesian Statistics__ from the [Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd Edition](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) book. While doing so, I am trying to complete some of the exercises using python [here](https://github.com/FBruzzesi/bda3-exercises)

* __Game Theory__ a subject that was on my _TODO_ list forever, I finally found some time to follow [Ben Polak course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM3rTU927io&list=PL6EF60E1027E1A10B&index=1&ab_channel=YaleCourses) from Yale University, available for free on Youtube.

###  ðŸ’» Side Project:

I recently released a [webapp](https://atp-stats.herokuapp.com/) on tennis ATP statistics and analytics for which I always look for feedbacks. 
I am currently working to extend with forecasting features and more. 
The data used are from the amazing [Jeff Sackmann github repo](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp).
